This script writes the insights to a file named `psych_profile.txt`.\n\nBefore you start, ensure you have installed the OpenAI Python client and you have an API key. You can install the library using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install openai\n```\n\nAnd here is the script:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport os\n\n# Define a function to generate AI insights\ndef generate_insights(assessment_scores):\n    # Use the OpenAI API to get insights\n    openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # Make sure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment\n\n    # Create a prompt for the AI model\n    prompt = (\n        "Given the following assessment scores in the ASAM psych profile, "\n        "generate personalized analysis and tailored feedback:\\n\\n"\n    )\n    for dimension, score in assessment_scores.items():\n        prompt += f"Dimension {dimension}: Score {score}\\n"\n    \n    prompt += "\\nProvide detailed insights based on these scores."\n\n    # Call the OpenAI API\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Choose an appropriate engine\n        prompt=prompt,\n        max_tokens=500,  # Adjust the length as necessary\n        n=1,\n        stop=None,\n        temperature=0.7  # Adjust creativity level\n    )\n\n    insights = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n    return insights\n\n# Example usage of the function\ndef main():\n    # Example assessment scores\n    assessment_scores = {\n        "1": 3,\n        "2": 2,\n        "3": 4,\n        "4": 1,\n        "5": 2,\n        "6": 3,\n    }\n\n    # Generate insights\n    insights = generate_insights(assessment_scores)\n\n    # Write the insights to a file\n    with open("psych_profile.txt", "w") as file:\n        file.write("AI-Powered Insights Based on ASAM Psych Profile\\n")\n        file.write("=" * 50 + "\\n\\n")\n        file.write(insights)\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n1. **OpenAI API Key**: Make sure you have your API key set up in your environment. You can do this by setting `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable.\n\n2. **API Costs**: Remember that using OpenAI\'s API will incur costs, so be mindful of your usage and consider setting up usage limits.\n\n3. **Prompt Design**: The quality of the insights relies heavily on the prompt you provide to the API. Adjust the prompt text to match the specific insights and feedback you require.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: For a production-ready script, you should add appropriate error handling to manage API requests and potential errors effectively. This example does not handle exceptions for simplicity.\n\n5. **Personalization and Limits**: Depending on how you want to tailor the feedback further, you might need additional data or context on individuals. Also, ensure to comply with privacy and data protection regulations when handling personal information.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1740152057, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_f9f4fb6dbf', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=674, prompt_tokens=77, total_tokens=751, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))
